60 Zone. 

A man has lost his car after he was caught driving at more than twice the speed limit west of Melbourne.

Police pulled over the Hilux ute on Boundary Road in Truganina on Friday evening after it was clocked travelling at 138km/h in a 60km/h zone.

The driver, a 23-year-old Sunshine man, is expected to be charged on summons with speeding. 

His vehicle was immediately impounded, police said.
